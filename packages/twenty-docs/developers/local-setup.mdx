## Prerequisites

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node v24.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

<Warning>
`npm` won't work, you should use `yarn` instead. Yarn is now shipped with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
You only have to run `corepack enable` to enable Yarn if you haven't done it yet.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command:

### SSH (Recommended)

If you haven't already set up SSH keys, you can learn how to do so [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```

### HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

## Step 2: Position yourself at the root

```bash
cd twenty
```

You should run all commands in the following steps from the root of the project.

## Step 3: Set up a PostgreSQL Database

### Mac OS

**Option 1 (preferred):** To provision your database locally with `brew`:

```bash
brew install postgresql@16
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"
brew services start postgresql@16
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE \"default\";" -c "CREATE DATABASE test;"
```

You can verify if the PostgreSQL server is running by executing:
```bash
brew services list
```

**Option 2:** If you have docker installed:
```bash
make postgres-on-docker
```

You can now access the database at [localhost:5432](localhost:5432), with user `postgres` and password `postgres`.

## Step 4: Set up a Redis Database (cache)

Twenty requires a redis cache to provide the best performance.

**Option 1 (preferred):** To provision your Redis locally with `brew`:
```bash
brew install redis
```

Start your redis server:
```bash
brew services start redis
```

**Option 2:** If you have docker installed:
```bash
make redis-on-docker
```

If you need a Client GUI, we recommend [redis insight](https://redis.io/insight/) (free version available).

## Step 5: Setup environment variables

Use environment variables or `.env` files to configure your project.

Copy the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./packages/twenty-front/.env.example ./packages/twenty-front/.env
cp ./packages/twenty-server/.env.example ./packages/twenty-server/.env
```

## Step 6: Installing dependencies

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following command:
```bash
yarn
```

<Note>
`npm` or `pnpm` won't work
</Note>

## Step 7: Running the project

Redis should already be running. If not, run:
```bash
brew services start redis
```

Set up your database with the following command:
```bash
npx nx database:reset twenty-server
```

Start the server, the worker and the frontend services:
```bash
npx nx start twenty-server
npx nx worker twenty-server
npx nx start twenty-front
```

Alternatively, you can start all services at once:
```bash
npx nx start
```

## Step 8: Use Twenty

**Frontend**

Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
You can log in using the default demo account: `tim@apple.dev` (password: `tim@apple.dev`)

**Backend**

- Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- The GraphQL API can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)
- The REST API can be reached at [http://localhost:3000/rest](http://localhost:3000/rest)
